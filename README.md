# TODO

### General

- Music
- Sounds
- Replace assets with free ones
- Cleaner variable/state handling. I don't like the Variables/GenVariables thing.
- Maybe cleaner "scene" handling. I don't like how you have to pass everything you want to use
	into the class, but it's okay for now.
- Merge Game class into Engine class?
- Remove all the debug keys:
	- K in game to win
	- E in game to lose
	- P in game to show collision info
	- V in battle to win
	- G to toggle flying
	- B to toggle boat
	- D to toggle puzzle pieces
- Use proper update timing (dt) instead of fixed 1/60
- Add fading between battle, victory, loss, intro, etc.
- GLFW doesn't allow pressing two keys at the same time for diagonal movement, or mabye I just don't understand how.

### In-game

- Add game controls pause menu option
- What happens when you ask for an audience with the king when already max rank? I think maybe there is no option.
- Better collision
- Add artifact textures
- Add artifact collision message
- Continent map should only reveal when you have the map
- Add flying hero texture
- Add flying key when all army can fly

### Battle

- Add archmage/druids shoot magic in battle
- Archers seem too tanky. Probably a bug there.
- Add HALF etc effect messages in battle
- Add AI
- Add out of control
